I remember you when it rains
Her eyes, her smile, i miss them so
Lost in thought, far away, I stare
Missing her dearly as raindrops fall

Must the night come, the cold winds may blow
In a blink of an eye, I miss her without reason
Having her in my arms, keeping her close
Alone, I long her beautiful soul


I fear to be the man her forsake
for having her suffer my immaturity
I made her sad, commited some mistakes
Deeply saddened, I offer sincere apology.

In this blissful story, the subject is you
For being your baby, I'm the luckiest, it's true

I remember you when it rains.
Your eyes, your smileâ€”I miss them so.
Lost in thought, far away, I stare,
Missing you dearly as raindrops fall.

I fear to be the man you forsake,
For having you suffer my immaturity.
I made you sad, committed some mistakes,
Deeply saddened, I offer a sincere apology.

Must the night come, the cold winds may blow.
In a blink of an eye, I miss you without reason,
Having you in my arms, keeping you close,
Alone, I long for your beautiful soul.


And in this blissful story, the subject is you,
For being your baby, I'm the luckiest, it's true.
