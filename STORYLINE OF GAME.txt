We are going to use the cardboard to build a ramp to act as an inclined planed which will be used in our  experimental set up



We taped the ruler on the wall to measure and control the height we are going to use in each trial


I remember you when it rains
Her eyes, her smile, i miss them so
Lost in thought, far away, I stare
Missing her dearly as raindrops fall

Must the night come, the cold winds may blow
In a blink of an eye, I miss her without reason
Having her in my arms, keeping her close
Alone, I long her beautiful soul


I fear to be the man her forsake
for having her suffer my immaturity
I made her sad, commited some mistakes
Deeply saddened, I offer sincere apology.

In this blissful story, the subject is you
For being your baby, I'm the luckiest, it's true

I remember you when it rains.
Your eyes, your smileâ€”I miss them so.
Lost in thought, far away, I stare,
Missing you dearly as raindrops fall.

I fear to be the man you forsake,
For having you suffer my immaturity.
I made you sad, committed some mistakes,
Deeply saddened, I offer a sincere apology.

Must the night come, the cold winds may blow.
In a blink of an eye, I miss you without reason,
Having you in my arms, keeping you close,
Alone, I long for your beautiful soul.


And in this blissful story, the subject is you,
For being your baby, I'm the luckiest, it's true.

The objective of this experiment was to investigate how the height of an inclined plane affects the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy in a rolling object.
