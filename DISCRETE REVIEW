DISCRETE REVIEW

-Relations are made when ordered pairs met the conditions
 	-You must get the cartesian product first
-Domains are the x, Range are all the y, when x maps to y (IN VALID RELATION)
	-Co domains are all the elements of y when the cartesian product is acquired
-Properties of Relations are:
	-Reflexive (a R a for all a on set A)
	-Symmetric (a R b and b R a on set A)
	-Transitive (a R b and b R c implies that a R c on set A)
	-Equivalence (all the above properties were met)

-functions are relations where x cannot be repeated
-quartic means polynomial of degree 4
-quintic means polynomial of degree 5
-a one-to-one (injective) function means that no two different elements in the domain are mapped to the same element in the co-domain.
-an onto (surjective) function means that no element in the co-domain is left unmatched or without a pre-image in the domain.
